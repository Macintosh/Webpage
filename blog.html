I'm a pretty slow learner, and a of of stuff in this class moved pretty fast.<br>That combined with the fact that for some reason this year I am unwilling to do any work at home, made for a pretty interisting class. Anyway, here's the things I liked and <br>didn't like.<br><br></em><div class="title">Likes:</div><em>Actual projects (like this one)<br>Learning to code<br><br></em><div class="title">Dislikes:</div><em>Pacing (Im sure I could have worked this out if I talked to you)<br>Khan Academy<br><br></em><div class="title"><b>Conclusion</b></div><em> I had fun in this class, and these mad coding skills are ptetty useful. I think the best part was this project, and I know you needed to get a basic understanding of code before<br>you started it, but next time, I think you should do more projects like this. I think people (at least me) learn more from doing than being taught, so maybe you could give people<brprojects and guide them through. It seems more daunting at the begining, but I think people will learn better that way.
